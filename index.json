We first use information on option prices for emissions allowances in the European Emissions Trading system to create the _Carbon VIX_, a market-based high-frequency measure of carbon price uncertainty. We then construct a measure of expected aggregate decarbonization investments via stock returns of \"carbon solution providers\". Consistent with real-option theory, we find a 10 percentage point increase in carbon price uncertainty has a similar negative impact on decarbonization activities as a EUR 11 decline in the carbon price. _Data available at: **www.carbonvix.org** _ ","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Carbon VIX: Carbon Price Uncertainty and Decarbonization Investments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682812800,"objectID":"80dc29da4943a0baa9fa07b6cd553de6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/permit_holdings/","publishdate":"2023-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/permit_holdings/","section":"project","summary":"\nBased on administrative data, I construct a novel dataset of firm-level holdings of emission permits in the EU Emission Trading System. Emission permits take a sizable share on firms' balance sheets and a majority of firms hold large quantities of emission permits in excess of their emission levels. I find evidence that holders of excess permits retain permit holdings to hedge future shocks to carbon prices. Firms with excess holdings (1) trade less, (2) sell more permits when carbon price uncertainty is low, and (3) show smaller reductions in future emissions. These results are consistent with models of firms' permit trading and decarbonization behavior under risk aversion and uncertainty and provide empirical evidence that carbon price uncertainty leads to limited trading participation and excess cost of decarbonization. **Data on Carbon Permit Holdings** ","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Carbon Permit Holdings","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682812800,"objectID":"50f5c712b19d10004e67e7fe466380d9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/bank_loans/","publishdate":"2023-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bank_loans/","section":"project","summary":"_with Martina Spaggiari_\nUsing Euro area banks' credit register data, information on borrowers' greenhouse gas emissions and their countries' degree of climate policy action (CPA), we study whether banks price climate-related policy risk in their corporate loan portfolios.
