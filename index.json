We first use information on option prices for emissions allowances in the European Emissions Trading system to create the _Carbon VIX_, a market-based high-frequency measure of carbon price uncertainty. We then construct a measure of expected aggregate decarbonization investments via stock returns of \"carbon solution providers\". Consistent with real-option theory, we find a 10 percentage point increase in carbon price uncertainty has a similar negative impact on decarbonization activities as a EUR 11 decline in the carbon price. _For paper and data, checkout our website below._ ","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Carbon VIX: Carbon Price Uncertainty and Decarbonization Investments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682812800,"objectID":"50f5c712b19d10004e67e7fe466380d9","permalink":"https://maximilian-fuchs.github.io/project/bank_loans/","publishdate":"2023-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bank_loans/","section":"project","summary":"_with Martina Spaggiari_\nUsing euro area banks' credit register data, information on borrowers' greenhouse gas emissions and their countries' degree of climate policy action (CPA), we study whether banks price climate-related policy risk in their corporate loan portfolios.

This effect is driven by loans originated after the adoption of the Paris Agreement and is more pronounced for long maturity loans.
